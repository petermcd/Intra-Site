# Intra Site

This is a basic intranet site that I have that will have following functionality:

## Network Topology

A topology of my network including hostrnames, ip's and the connections between devices.

## Finances

A break down of my finances, these include monthly bills and outstanding debts.
The debts also include a run down of how many payments will be required (currently assumes
a monthly payment)

## Service Links

Links to services that I run on the local network
